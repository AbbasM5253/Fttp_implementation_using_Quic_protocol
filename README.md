QUIC PROTOCOL 

QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a modern, high-performance, and secure transport protocol developed by Google. It is designed to facilitate data transmission over the internet and offers several key advantages over 
the traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

QUIC operates on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and is designed to improve data transfer efficiency.It incorporates features like reduced latency,faster connection establishment, and enhanced security, making it
particularly well-suited for real-time  applications and web traffic.
